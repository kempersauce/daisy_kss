# README.md

### Getting Started
- Download [plugdata](https://plugdata.org/)
- Download [pd2dsy](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy) *(not sure if this is necessary but the pd2dsy gui is much nicer for flashing to daisy than using plugdata)*
- Clone this repo wherever you fancy

### About
Pretty simple setup:
- **/pd** contains our puredata patches
- **/json** contains the json file that defines the params for the daisy *(see [this guide](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/quick-guide-on-setting-up-a-custom-json-file-for-pd2dsy-oopsy/4021) on custom jsons for daisy)*

Flashing can be accomplished in plugdata via hamburger menu -> compile (lots of menu diving)  or with pd2dsy gui
